# Privacy Policy

Effective date: February 11, 2026

This Privacy Policy explains how Pyrox handles information when you use the Pyrox iOS app, web UI, and related API.

## Who operates Pyrox

Pyrox is an independent project. The app and API are currently served from:

- App/web client: Pyrox UI
- API endpoint: `https://pyrox-api.fly.dev`
- Project repository: `https://github.com/vmatei2/pyrox-client`

## Information we process

Pyrox is designed to work without account creation.

We may process:

- Query inputs you provide in the app (for example athlete name searches, race filters, and report parameters).
- Technical request data needed to operate the service (for example IP address, user agent, request timestamps, and error logs).

We do not intentionally collect sensitive personal data, payment details, or precise location data.

## How we use information

We use information to:

- Return requested analytics and reports.
- Maintain service reliability, security, and performance.
- Investigate and fix bugs or abuse.

## Sharing

We do not sell personal data.

Data may be processed by infrastructure providers that host or operate the service (for example cloud hosting and networking providers) strictly to run Pyrox.

## Data retention

Operational logs and request metadata are retained only as long as reasonably needed for reliability, security, and troubleshooting, then deleted or rotated.

## Your choices

You can stop using the app at any time. If you have a privacy request, contact us using the project support channel below.

## Children's privacy

Pyrox is not directed to children under 13, and we do not knowingly collect personal information from children under 13.

## Changes to this policy

We may update this policy from time to time. Material updates will be posted on this page with a new effective date.
