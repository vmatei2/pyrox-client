> Load HYROX race results into pandas in a few lines. Built for people who love fitness *and* data.

Unofficial Python client for HYROX race results — load public results into pandas DataFrames in a few lines. Built for people who love fitness and data: analyse performance trends, understand HYROX’s unique demands, and open up new research avenues. 

## Install

```commandline
uv pip install pyrox-client
```
or 
```commandline
pip install pyrox-client
```

## Quickstart
Below we have added two quick examples. One of loading race data - with different data requests, and one of retrieving race data / extracting athlete information and plotting values with example outputs to show a small glimpse of the analysis possible if 
retrieving the race data.

```commandline
import pyrox

# Create client
client = pyrox.PyroxClient()

# Discover available races
all_races = client.list_races()          
s6_races = client.list_races(season=6)   

# Get multiple races from a season
subset_s6 = client.get_season(season=6, locations=["london", "hamburg"])

# Get single race df
london_race = client.get_race(season=6, location="london")
rott_race = client.get_race(season=6, location="rotterdam")
london_male = client.get_race(season=6, location="london", gender="male")
#  Returning data for May (London Olympia race)
london_2025_s7 = client.get_race(season=7, location="london", year=2025)
#  Returning data for November (London Excel Race)
london_2024_s7 = client.get_race(season=7, location="london", year=2024)
```

## What's included? 

- Servers publicly available race results from the offical results website
- Historical coverage of Season 2-7 (for now) (season 5 and 6 are most used/tested in analysis; please open issues for any data problems spotted)
- Client-side caching by default (local). Set ```use_cache=False``` when querying ```get_race()``` or ```get_season()``` to opt out.
- Going forward - would like to add server-side computed stats and option for enriching filters (i..e "overall time sub 60 mins / only athletes with wall ball time sub 5 mins"")


## API

```commandline
list_races(season: int | None = None) -> pd.DataFrame
```

 - returns a Dataframe of available races
```commandline
from pyrox import PyroxClient

client = PyroxClient()
print(client.list_races(season=5).head(3))
#    season   location
# 0       5  amsterdam
# 1       5    anaheim
# 2       5  barcelona
```


```commandline
get_race(
    season: int,
    location: str,
    year: int | None = None,
    gender: str | None = None,      # "male" | "female" | "mixed"
    division: str | None = None,    # "open" | "pro" (case-insensitive contains)
    use_cache: bool = True,
) -> pd.DataFrame
```
- returns a single race as a pandas dataframe - with optional filtering

```commandline
get_season(
    season: int,
    locations: list[str] | None = None,
    use_cache: bool = True,
) -> pd.DataFrame
```
- returns a combinded Dataframe for a whole season (or a set of locations passed in)
```commandline
clear_cache(pattern: str = "*") -> None
```
- clears local cache entries (regex pattern search option included)

```commandline
cache_info() -> dict
```
- returns cache statistics: `````{"total_size": int, "total_items": int, "items": list[str]}`````

###  Example - compare an athlete's two races vs field averages

> below code requires ```pandas``` and ```numpy``` and the graphs are generated via ```matplotlib``` and ```seaborn```

```commandline
import pandas as pd
import numpy as np
import pyrox

client = pyrox.PyroxClient()

run_cols = [f"run{i}_time" for i in range(1, 8+1)]
station_cols = [
    "skiErg_time","sledPush_time","sledPull_time","burpeeBroadJump_time",
    "rowErg_time","farmersCarry_time","sandbagLunges_time","wallBalls_time",
]
station_labels = ["SkiErg","Sled Push","Sled Pull","BBJ","Row","Farmers","Lunges","Wall Balls"]

def pick_athlete_row(df: pd.DataFrame, athlete: str) -> pd.Series:
    m = df["name"].astype(str).str.contains(athlete, case=False, na=False)
    sub = df[m]
    if sub.empty:
        raise ValueError(f"Athlete '{athlete}' not found")
    return sub.iloc[0]

rot = client.get_race(season=6, location="rotterdam", gender="male", division="open")
bcn = client.get_race(season=7, location="barcelona", gender="male", division="open")

athlete = "surname, name"
user_rot = pick_athlete_row(rot, athlete)
user_bcn = pick_athlete_row(bcn, athlete)

rot_run_avg = rot[run_cols].mean()
bcn_run_avg = bcn[run_cols].mean()
rot_sta_avg = rot[station_cols].mean()
bcn_sta_avg = bcn[station_cols].mean()

runs_cmp = pd.DataFrame({
    "segment": range(1, 9),
    "Rotterdam (athlete)": [user_rot[c] for c in run_cols],
    "Barcelona (athlete)": [user_bcn[c] for c in run_cols],
}).set_index("segment")

stations_cmp = pd.DataFrame({
    "station": station_labels,
    "Rotterdam (athlete)": [user_rot.get(c, np.nan) for c in station_cols],
    "Barcelona (athlete)": [user_bcn.get(c, np.nan) for c in station_cols],
}).set_index("station")

```
